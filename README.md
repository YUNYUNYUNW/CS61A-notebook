This is what we learn about programming after we have a visit to Zhangjiang technology company.
The main courses are CS61A and CS61B and both are from Berkley University.
This repository is only used to record our learning experience and some important note, not for application.
Welcome to communicate with me if you're a new CS learner with high demand for systematical learning!
